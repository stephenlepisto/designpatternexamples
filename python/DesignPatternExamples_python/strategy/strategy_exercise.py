# Implementation of the Strategy_Exercise() function as used in the 
# @ref strategy_pattern "Strategy pattern".


##  Example of using the @ref strategy_pattern "Strategy" design pattern.
#  
#  The Strategy pattern provides a way to easily assign different
#  algorithms to a class instance that can be changed at the time the
#  class is created.
#  
#  In this exercise, the Strategy_ShowEntries_Class instance sorts
#  and displays a list of EntryInformation elements.  Three different
#  sorting strategies are provided (Name, Age, Height) and an option
#  to reverse the normal order of the sort.
