# Implementation of the Composite_Exercise() function as used in the 
# @ref composite_pattern "Composite pattern".


## Example of using the @ref composite_pattern "Composite" design pattern.
# 
#  The Composite pattern is used when a collection of objects is to
#  be formed in a hierarchical form where each object needs to be
#  treated like any other object but some objects can contain other
#  objects.
# 
#  This example uses a file structure of file and directories to
#  represent each object type.
