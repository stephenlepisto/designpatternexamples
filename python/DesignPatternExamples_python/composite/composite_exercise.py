# Implementation of the
# @ref DesignPatternExamples_python.composite.composite_exercise.Composite_Exercise "Composite_Exercise"()
# function as used in the @ref composite_pattern.


## Example of using the @ref composite_pattern.
# 
#  The Composite pattern is used when a collection of objects is to
#  be formed in a hierarchical form where each object needs to be
#  treated like any other object but some objects can contain other
#  objects.
# 
#  This example uses a file structure of file and directories to
#  represent each object type.

# ! [Using Composite in Python]
def Composite_Exercise():
    print()
    print("Composite Exercise")

    print("  Done.")
