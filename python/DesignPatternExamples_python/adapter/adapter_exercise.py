# @brief
# Implementation of the Adapter_Exercise() function as used in the 
# @ref adapter_pattern "Adapter pattern".


## Example of using the @ref adapter_pattern "Adapter" design pattern.
# 
# This example adapts functions that return error codes into a class object
# that throws exceptions, which is more fitting of an object-oriented
# language.
