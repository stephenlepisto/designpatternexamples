## Overview

A treatise on the patterns defined in the book, *Design Patterns: Elements of
Object-Oriented Software*, by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides.

These patterns appeared over and over in the many years that object-oriented
programming grew and matured.  In 1995, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph
Johnson, and JOhn Vlissides formalized 23 patterns into a book, the first of
its kind.
