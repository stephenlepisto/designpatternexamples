# Design Pattern Examples {#mainpage}

Created by Stephen P. Lepisto

## Overview

A treatise on the patterns defined in the book, *Design Patterns: Elements of
Object-Oriented Software*, by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides.

These patterns appeared over and over in the many years that object-oriented
programming grew and matured.  In 1995, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph
Johnson, and John Vlissides formalized 23 patterns into a book, the first of
its kind.

To be sure, these patterns exited before the Design Patterns book was written,
which is why the Gang of Four wrote the book.  It was an attempt to formalize
the most well-known patterns, to provide terminology, methodology, and a place
to start discussions on the discipline of creating software.

This documentation is built from my efforts to implement most of the design
patterns in four different programming languages: C, C++, C#, and Python.  I
also converted the patterns to Rust, but since Doxygen does not know how to
parse Rust, I have captured the Rust source code in its own documentation site.
