# Prototype Pattern{#prototype_pattern}

At its simplest, the Prototype design means creating a new instance of a
specific class and then cloning that object and tweaking the clone's
attributes to provide slightly different behavior.  The idea is to not
represent a large set of objects that differ only in minor ways as separate
classes or sub-classes in source code.  Instead, the objects are copied
from an initial object and then tweaked for each individual purpose -- at
runtime.

## How to Use

I did not write any examples of a Prototype design pattern.
